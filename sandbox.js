//Variables can only start with uderscore or doller we cnt start it by a number
// we cnt use let and const together

let age = 25;
let year = 2019;
// Let is used when we want to make chnge in the variables in the future
// Generaly use let

//Comment
//log things to console
console.log(age, year);

age = 30;
console.log(age);

// Const is used when we dont want to make any changes in it in future even by a mistake
// when you dont want to overright then use constant 
const points = 100;

console.log(points);


//var is old keyword or old way 
var score = 75;
console.log(score);

// but we will use let and const
